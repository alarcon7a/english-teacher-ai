In the fourth and last section\\nof the TOEFL, you will write an essay about a topic that will be assigned to\\nyou. You will have 30 minutes to write a three- to five-paragraph essay on that\\ntopic. You must write on the topic you are assigned. An essay on any topic\\nother than the one assigned will receive a score of “0.”\\nBefore the topic is presented, you must choose whether to type your essay on\\nthe computer or to hand write your essay on the paper essay answer sheet\\nprovided. Scratch paper will be given to you for making notes. For the\\npaper-based TOEFL, the final version must be on the single-page, two-sided\\nessay answer sheet. For the CBT or iBT version of the TOEFL, you will\\ncompose the final version of your essay in the “essay box” on the computer\\nscreen. The essay topic will be presented to you on the computer screen.\\nYou will not know the topic ahead of time. Although you must write only on\\nthe topic that is assigned to you, there is a way to prepare for this section.\\nYour essay score will depend upon your ability to compose a well-written essay\\nthat answers the question in a relatively short period of time—in this case, 30\\nminutes. Your essay must be well organized and well developed; you must\\nprovide the reader with clearly appropriate details to support your thesis or\\nillustrate your ideas. Your writing should show, throughout the essay, that\\nyou’re comfortable expressing complex ideas in the English language. You\\nshould also use a variety of grammatical structures (clauses, tenses, etc.) and\\nuse a vocabulary that is appropriate to your topic.\\n...............................................................................\\nchapter 1\\n3'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'src/Master the TOEFL Writing Skills (Petersons Master the TOEFL Writing Skills).pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Preparing Your First Version of the Essay\\nTHE PLAN\\nWriting is a process, like a recipe for a special meal. You have a good chance of succeeding as\\nan essayist if you follow these directions. The first step in the writing process is to have a\\nplan.\\nAn essay should have:\\n• an introduction,\\n• a body, and\\n• a conclusion.\\nIn the introduction, you get the reader’s attention and tell the reader what you are going to\\nwrite about. You also give the reader any special information that guides the reader to the\\nbody of your essay. In the case of a TOEFL essay, the introduction should be one paragraph\\nthat contains four to five sentences.\\nThe body of the essay should be made up of one to three paragraphs that contain the ideas you\\nwant to communicate to the reader.\\nThe conclusion, which should be one paragraph, summarizes what you wrote in the body and\\nreveals the conclusion you want the reader to make.\\nDo not write the essay without planning. Begin the process by “brainstorming.”\\nBRAINSTORMING\\nIn all writing classes, there is an exercise calledbrainstorming, which helps you start the flow\\nof ideas necessary for an essay. This process involves writing words and phrases that are\\nrelated to your topic as they come into your head. For example, look at the following topic:\\nWhat are some of the qualities of a good parent? Use specific details and examples\\nto explain your answer.\\nDepending on your beliefs, you might write down the following words while brainstorming:\\nStrength of character\\nLove of family life\\nEarn a living\\nSpends time with children\\nSet an example\\nHelp children with emotional problems in adolescence\\n4 PART I: TOEFL Writing Basics\\n.................................................................\\n............................................................................................\\nwww.petersons.com'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'src/Master the TOEFL Writing Skills (Petersons Master the TOEFL Writing Skills).pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='WRITE SENTENCES ABOUT WHAT YOU BRAINSTORM\\nThese are simple sentences that help you put ideas into complete form, but the sentences are\\nin no way the final version that you will submit.\\nYou might come up with sentences such as:\\n• A parent should earn money to provide food, clothing, and shelter for his or her\\nfamily.\\n• A parent should not work so many hours that he or she ignores the family.\\n• Parents should show affection to their children, hugging and being affectionate with\\nthem as their culture calls for.\\n• Parents should encourage their children to study in school by setting the example of\\nworking hard at their jobs and at home.\\nWriting these sentences should take you about 5 minutes.\\nLOGICAL ORDER\\nAfter you have written your sentences, put them into a logical order. That is, arrange the\\norder of sentences so that they relate to one another in a logical sequence. Then, decide which\\nsentences should go into the introduction, the body, and the conclusion. You will probably find\\nthat you need more sentences. If so, write them at this time, and place them in the\\nappropriate paragraphs in the appropriate section of the essay. Do not spend too much time\\nwriting the sentences. In the margins next to the sentences, write numbers that will indicate\\nthe proper order of the sentences. This should take 3 to 5 minutes.\\nWRITE TOPIC SENTENCES FOR ALL THE PARAGRAPHS IN YOUR ESSAY\\nA topic sentence contains the controlling idea of a paragraph and tells the reader what the\\nparagraph is about. Look at your sentences and decide which one should begin the\\nintroductory paragraph, which ones should begin the paragraphs in the body, and which one\\nshould begin the conclusion. You may have already written some topic sentences. If not, write\\nthose that are needed. This should take you about 5 minutes.\\nWRITE THE ESSAY\\nYou now have 10 minutes to put the essay into final shape. You have all the ideas, sentences,\\nand paragraphs in the correct order, but you need to check your sentences for grammar and\\nspelling errors. Then, following the numbers in your margin, write your sentences in the\\ncorrect order in the final draft.\\n.................................................................\\n............................................................................................\\nChapter 1: All About TOEFL Writing 5\\nwww.petersons.com'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'src/Master the TOEFL Writing Skills (Petersons Master the TOEFL Writing Skills).pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Write About One Choice\\nYou now have a process to write the essay, but there are rules that you should follow when\\nlooking at your assigned topic. There are 185 possible topics for the essay, but there are only\\nfour ways that the topic is stated. If you learn to recognize the kind of topic that you have been\\nassigned, you will be able to organize your writing more efficiently.\\nMost essay topics ask you to make a choice. For example:\\nSome people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to\\nprepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and\\nexamples to support your answer.\\nYou probably enjoy eating in restaurants and at home, depending on your mood, your work\\nschedule, or your diet. However, do not write an essay that says that sometimes you like\\neating in a restaurant and sometimes at home. You must choose one or the other if you want\\nto write an essay that answers the question correctly.\\nOther topics ask you whether you agree or disagree with a statement. Others will ask you to\\ntell which is better or whether you support one thing or another. These topics require you to\\nchooseonly onething and write about it. Do not write about both.\\nOne kind of topic can easily deceive you. Read the following:\\nNowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way\\npeople live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\\nThis topic asks you to make a choice, but it may not be obvious. It is not about food. It’s about\\nthe way food preparation affects the way people live. You have to choose between two possible\\nopinions. Opinion one is “The change in food preparation has improved the way people live.”\\nThe other is “The change has not improved the way people live.” Make sure your essay covers\\nthe right topic.\\nSINGLE TOPICS\\nThere are some types of questions that ask you to choose the topic yourself. These topics are\\noften referred to as “desert island questions.” For example:\\nIf you had to live on a desert island and could have only one book to read, what\\nwould it be? Explain your answer, using specific reasons and details.\\nThe topic question gives you the circumstances of your choice, but it leaves the choice of the\\ndetails of your answer up to you. A more likely topic is as follows:\\nIf you could study a subject that you have never had the opportunity to study, what\\nwould you choose? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.\\n6 PART I: TOEFL Writing Basics\\n.................................................................\\n............................................................................................\\nwww.petersons.com'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'src/Master the TOEFL Writing Skills (Petersons Master the TOEFL Writing Skills).pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Here is the desert island question in a slightly different form. You have to write about one\\nacademic subject, not necessarily one that you always wanted to study, but also one that\\nmight have helped you in a particular way or one that your parents would have been pleased\\nabout. Whatever subject you write about, you must provide details about your desires or those\\nof your parents. Or, you could write about the way the course would have helped your work.\\nCAUSE AND EFFECT TOPICS\\nSome topics require you to identify causes, effects, and causes and effects together. Look at\\nthe following example:\\nHow do movies or television influence people’s behavior? Use reasons and specific\\nexamples to support your answer.\\nIn this example, the statement gives you the cause, “movies or television.” It is your job to\\nwrite about the effect of these media on people’s behavior.\\nIn the following example, the statement gives you the effect:\\nWhy do you think some people are attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous\\nactivities? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\\nThe effect is “some people are attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous activities.”\\nYou must write about the causes of this attraction.\\nIn the following example, you are required to write about both cause and effect:\\nPeople do many different things to stay healthy. What do you do for good health?\\nUse specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\\nYou must write about what you do for good health, which is the cause. You must also write\\nabout the effect of what you do.\\n“MANY THINGS” TOPICS\\nTopics often require you to report several facts. For example:\\nFilms can tell us a lot about the country where they were made. What have you\\nlearned about a country from watching its movies? Use specific examples and\\ndetails to support your response.\\nTo write this essay, you have to choose a film from a country other than your own—a film that\\nis about the country that produced it. You have to say what you learned about that country\\nfrom watching its movies. If the movies had been Francis Ford Coppola’sThe Godfather, Parts\\n1, 2, and 3, what would you have learned about America? About Italian immigrants in\\nAmerica? About Italian-American actors? About the causes of organized crime in America?\\n.................................................................\\n............................................................................................\\nChapter 1: All About TOEFL Writing 7\\nwww.petersons.com'),\n",

About political and economic power? Let’s look at the\\nnext example:\\nPeople listen to music for different reasons and at different times. Why is music\\nimportant to many people? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.\\nThis topic has been the subject of magazine articles, long books, and even encyclopedias. You\\nmust write not about the kinds of music found throughout the world but about the reasons\\nthat people listen to it, e.g., relaxation, religious devotion, or artistic engagement. Before you\\nbegin writing your essay, make sure you are focusing on the correct idea.\\nCLASSIFYING THE TOPICS\\nIn the TOEFL Bulletin, there is a list of 185 topics from which your assigned topic will be\\nchosen. You should become familiar with this list and take extra time to practice writing\\nessays before you take the computer-based TOEFL test.\\nTo see a list of possible assigned topics, go to www.toefl.org and download the entire list. To\\nhelp yourself become familiar with the topics, try to break them down into categories such as\\nthe following:\\nGoing to College\\nGoing to Elementary and High School\\nParents and Children\\nFood\\nNew Things in Your Life\\nThe Media\\nPersonal Preferences\\nYour Beliefs\\nWork\\nSpending Money\\nTravel and Transportation\\nTechnology\\nSociety\\nThe Culture of Your Country\\nEcology\\nSports and Recreation\\nUsing the steps you learned here, practice writing on a variety of these topics from each of the\\ncategories. There is no way to memorize an essay or all of the questions, but you can become\\nmore comfortable with the types of questions and the process of writing an essay under timed\\nconditions.\\nTHE INTEGRATED WRITING TASK OF THE TOEFL iBT\\nOn the TOEFL iBT, you will read a passage and then hear a lecture that is related to the topic\\nof the passage. You will be asked to summarize the listening passage and explain how it\\nrelates to the points in the reading passage. The suggested length of your written response is\\nbetween 150 and 225 words. You must remember to make sure that your response clearly\\nrelates to the question posed. This is not a writing exercise that asks for your opinion. Also\\nremember that you are being asked to explain the points you’ve heard.\\n8 PART I: TOEFL Writing Basics\\n.................................................................\\n............................................................................................\\nwww.petersons.com'),\n",

A topic of increasing relevance to the conservation of marine life is bycatch—fish and other \\nanimals that are unintentionally caught in the process of fishing for a targeted population of \\nfish. Bycatch is a common occurrence in longline fishing, which utilizes a long heavy fishing \\nline with baited hooks placed at intervals, and in trawling, which utilizes a fishing net (trawl) \\nthat is dragged along the ocean floor or through the mid-ocean waters. Few fisheries employ \\ngear that can catch one species to the exclusion of all others. Dolphins, whales, and turtles \\nare frequently captured in nets set for tunas and billfishes, and seabirds and turtles are caught \\nin longline sets. Because bycatch often goes unreported, it is difficult to accurately estimate \\nits extent. Available data indicate that discarded biomass (organic matter from living things) \\namounts to 25–30 percent of official catch, or about 30 million metric tons. \\n2. The bycatch problem is particularly acute when trawl nets with small mesh sizes (smaller-\\nthan-average holes in the net material) are dragged along the bottom of the ocean in pursuit \\nof groundfish or shrimp. Because of the small mesh size of the shrimp trawl nets, most of the \\nfishes captured are either juveniles (young), smaller than legal size limits, or undesirable \\nsmall species. Even larger mesh sizes do not prevent bycatch because once the net begins to \\nfill with fish or shrimp, small individuals caught subsequently are trapped without ever \\nencountering the mesh. In any case, these incidental captures are unmarketable and are \\nusually shoveled back over the side of the vessel dead or dying. \\n3. The bycatch problem is complicated economically and ecologically. Bycatch is a liability to \\nshrimp fishers, clogging the nets and increasing fuel costs because of increased drag \\n(resistance) on the vessel. Sorting the catch requires time, leading to spoilage of harvested \\nshrimp and reduced time for fishing. Ecologically, high mortality rates among juvenile fishes \\ncould contribute to population declines of recreational and commercial species. Evidence to \\nthis effect exists for Gulf of Mexico red snapper and Atlantic Coast weakfish. Because the \\nnear-shore areas where shrimp concentrate are also important nursery grounds for many fish \\nspecies, shrimp trawling could have a profound impact on stock size. \\n4. Once the dead or dying bycatch is returned to the ecosystem, it is consumed by predators, \\ndetritivores (organisms that eat dead plant and animal matter), and decomposers (organisms \\nthat break down dead or decaying organic matter), which could have a positive effect on \\nsport fish, seabird, crab, and even shrimp populations. Available evidence indicates that 40– \\n60 percent of the 30 metric tons of catch discarded annually by commercial fishing vessels, \\nand even more of the noncatch waste (organisms killed but never brought to the surface), \\ndoes not lie unused on the bottom of the sea. It becomes available to midwater and ocean-\\nbottom scavengers, transferring material into their food web and making energy available to \\nforagers (organisms that search for food) that is normally tied up in ocean-bottom, deep-\\nocean, midwater, and open-ocean species. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

Overfishing and overdiscarding may thus contribute to a syndrome known as “fishing down \\nof food webs,” whereby we eliminate apex  (top)  predators and large species while \\ntransforming the ocean into a simplified system increasingly dominated by microbes, \\njellyfish, ocean-bottom invertebrates, plankton, and planktivores. The strongest evidence for \\nthe fishing down phenomenon exists in global catch statistics that show alarming shifts in \\nspecies composition from high-value, near-bottom species to lower-value, open-ocean \\nspecies. In the last three decades of the twentieth century, the global fishing fleet doubled in \\nsize and technology advanced immeasurably. Despite increased effort and technology, total \\ncatch stabilized, but landing rates (rates at which species are caught) of the most valuable \\nspecies fell by 25 percent. \\n6. Conservation organizations have condemned the obvious and extreme waste associated with \\nbycatch. Public concern over high mortality rates of endangered marine turtles captured in \\nshrimp trawls led to the development of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the 1980s. TEDs \\nwere incorporated into the shrimp net design with the purpose of directing turtles out of nets \\nwithout unacceptably reducing shrimp catches. Marine engineers and fishers also developed \\nshrimp net designs that incorporate bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), taking advantage of \\nbehavioral differences between shrimp and fish, or between different fishes, in order to \\nseparate fishes. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

There is a quality of cohesiveness about the Roman world that applied neither to Greece nor \\nperhaps to any other civilization, ancient or modern. Like the stones of a Roman wall, which \\nwere held together both by the regularity of the design and by that peculiarly powerful \\nRoman cement, so the various parts of the Roman realm were bonded into a massive, \\nmonolithic entity by physical, organizational, and psychological controls. The physical \\nbonds included the network of military garrisons, which were stationed in every province, \\nand the network of stone-built roads that linked the provinces with Rome. The organizational \\nbonds were based on the common principles of law and administration and on the universal \\narmy of officials who enforced common standards of conduct. The psychological controls \\nwere built on fear and punishment—on the absolute certainty that anyone or anything that \\nthreatened the authority of Rome would be utterly destroyed. \\n2. The source of the Roman obsession with unity and cohesion may well have lain in the \\npattern of Rome’s early development. Whereas Greece had grown from scores of scattered \\ncities, Rome grew from one single organism. While the Greek world had expanded along the \\nMediterranean Sea lanes, the Roman world was assembled by territorial conquest. Of course, \\nthe contrast is not quite so stark: in Alexander the Great the Greeks had found the greatest \\nterritorial conqueror of all time; and the Romans, once they moved outside Italy, did not fail \\nto learn the lessons of sea power. Yet the essential difference is undeniable. The key to the \\nGreek world lay in its high-powered ships; the key to Roman power lay in its marching \\nlegions. The Greeks were wedded to the sea; the Romans, to the land. The Greek was a sailor \\nat heart; the Roman, a landsman. \\n3. Certainly, in trying to explain the Roman phenomenon, one would have to place great \\nemphasis on this almost animal instinct for the territorial imperative. Roman priorities lay in \\nthe organization, exploitation, and defense of their territory. In all probability it was the \\nfertile plain of Latium, where the Latins who founded Rome originated, that created the \\nhabits and skills of landed settlement, landed property, landed economy, landed \\nadministration, and a land-based society. From this arose the Roman genius for military \\norganization and orderly government. In turn, a deep attachment to the land, and to the \\nstability which rural life engenders, fostered the Roman virtues: gravitas, a sense of \\nresponsibility, peitas, a sense of devotion to family and country, and iustitia, a sense of the \\nnatural order. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

Your-your reading \\nassignment for the next class—it has a diagram that shows this very clearly— \\nso anyway as I was saying… By analyzing these echoes, the bat can \\ndetermine, say, if there’s a wall in a cave that it needs to avoid… and—how \\nfar away it is. Another thing it uses ultrasound to detect, is the size and shape \\nof objects. For example, one echo they’d quickly identify is the one they \\nassociate with a moth, which is common prey for a bat—particularly, a moth \\nbeating its wings. However, moths happen to have a major advantage over \\nmost other insects: they can detect ultrasound. This means that, when a bat \\napproaches, the moth can detect the bat’s presence… so it has time to escape \\nto safety… or else they can just remain motionless—since, um, when they \\nstop beating their wings, they’d be much harder for the bat to distinguish \\nfrom, oh, a-a leaf… or-or some other object… \\nNow, we’ve tended to underestimate just how sophisticated the abilities of \\nanimals that use ultrasound are. In fact, we kind of assumed that they were \\nfiltering a lot out—uh, the way a sophisticated radar system can ignore echoes \\nfrom stationary objects on the ground. Radar does this to remove “ground \\nclutter”—information about, um, hills or buildings that it doesn’t need… but \\nbats—we thought they were filtering out this kind of information because \\nthey simply couldn’t analyze it. But it looks as if we were wrong. Recently, \\nthere was this experiment with trees and a specific species of bats—a bat \\ncalled the lesser spear-nosed bat. Now a tree should be a huge acoustical \\nchallenge for a bat, right? I mean, it’s got all kinds of surfaces, with different \\nshapes and angles… So, well, the echoes from a tree are going to be a \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

Not like the echo from a moth. So, \\nwe thought, for a long time, that bats stopped their evaluation at simply \\n“that’s a tree.” Yet, it turns out that-that bats, or at least this particular species, \\ncan not only tell that it’s a tree, but can also distinguish between, say, a pine \\ntree and a deciduous tree—like, a maple, or an oak tree: just by their leaves— \\nan-and when I say “leaves,” I mean pine needles, too.

And if the seeds land in a \\nsuitable habitat, they do well and reproduce. \\nWith active habitat selection, an organism is able to physically select where to \\nlive and breed, and because an animal’s breeding habitat is so important, we’d \\nexpect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of \\nhabitats, places where their offspring have the best chance of survival. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

And as we’ve discussed, there’re some key elements that a habitat \\nmust contain: food, obviously. Water; and it’s got to have the right climate; \\nand spaces for physical protection.

So, if there’re people or  dogs on the beach, the eggs \\nand fledglings in the nests are really vulnerable. Out in California, where  \\nthere’s been a lot of human development by the ocean, the plovers are now a  \\nthreatened species.  \\nSo, conservationists tried to create a new habitat for them. They made \\nartificial beaches and sandbars in areas inaccessible to people and dogs.

They actually nest in the shrubs, not the trees so they’re pretty close to \\nthe ground but these warblers also nest in forests that have low shrub density. \\nIt’s usually the younger warblers that nest in these areas because the preferred \\nspots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older, more dominant \\nbirds. \\nFemale Professor  And the choice of habitat seems to affect reproductive success. Because the \\nolder, more experienced birds, who nest in the high- density shrub areas, have \\nsignificantly more offspring than those in low-density areas.

For example, in Europe, studies have been done of \\nblackcap warblers—we just call them blackcaps. \\nFemale Professor  The blackcap can be found in two different environments. Ah, their preferred \\nhabitat is forests near the edges of streams. However, blackcaps also live in \\npine woods away from water. Studies’ve been done on the reproductive \\nsuccess rates for the birds in both areas and the results showed— \\nsurprisingly—that the reproductive success was essentially the same in both \\nareas—the preferred and the second- choice habitat. Well, why? \\nFemale Professor  It turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs, or couples, \\nliving in the stream-edge habitat compared to the area away from the stream. \\nSo, the stream-edge area had a much denser population, which meant more \\nmembers of the same species \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

So, the results of the studies suggest \\nthat when the number of competitors in the prime habitat reaches a certain \\npoint, the second-ranked habitat becomes just as successful as the prime \\nhabitat, just because there are fewer members of the same species living there. \\nSo, it looks like competition for resources is another important factor in \\ndetermining if a particular habitat is suitable. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

Now, uh back then, eh \\ntheir lives depended on the natural resources of the forest, especially the birch \\ntree.

And this tough protective outer layer of the \\ntree, this, this white bark, is waterproof, and this waterproof quality of the \\nbark oh it made it useful for making things like cooking containers, um …a-a \\nvariety of utensils. \\nAnd…i-if you peel birch bark in the winter––eh we call it the “winter  bark”–– \\num,  another  layer,  a  tougher  inner  layer  of  the  tree adheres  to  the  bark,  \\nproducing  a  stronger  material…so  the  “winter bark” was used for larger \\nutensils and containers.  \\nMale Student  Umm, I know people make utensils out of wood, but utensils out of tree bark? \\nFemale Professor  Well, birch bark is pliable and very easy to bend. The Native Americans \\nwould cut the bark and fold it into any shape they needed, then secure it with \\ncords until it dried. They could fold the bark into many shapes. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

The taste of the birch tree \\ndoesn’t get transferred to the food—so it was perfect for cooking containers. \\nEh but the most important use of the bark by  far was the canoe. Since the \\nnortheast region of North America is uh it’s interconnected by many streams \\nand waterways, water transportation  by  vessels  like  a  canoe  was  most  \\nessential.  The  paths through the woods were often overgrown, so, so water  \\ntravel was much faster. And here’s what the Native Americans did…they \\nwould peel large sheets of bark from the tree to form lightweight yet sturdy \\ncanoes. The bark was stretched over frames made from tree branches, uh \\nstitched together and sealed with resin—y-you know  that, that sticky liquid  \\nthat comes out of the tree—and when it dries, it’s watertight. One great thing \\nabout these birch bark canoes was, uh they could carry a large amount of \\ncargo. F-For example, a  canoe weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to 9 \\npeople and 250 pounds of cargo.  \\nFemale  Student  Wow! But…how far could they travel that way? \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

The canoes allowed them to travel over \\na vast area that-that today would take a few hours to fly over. You see, the \\nNative Americans made canoes of all types, for travel on small streams or on \\nlarge open ocean waters. For small streams they made narrow, maneuverable \\nboats, while, while larger canoes were needed for the ocean. They could \\ntravel throughout the area, only occasionally having to portage, um to, to, \\ncarry the canoe over land a short distance eh to another nearby stream. And \\nsince the canoes were so light…this wasn’t a difficult task. \\nNow, how do you think this affected their lives? \\nFemale Student  Well,  if  they  could  travel  so  easily  over  such  a  large  area,  they could trade  \\nwith people from other areas…which I guess, would…lead them to form \\nalliances?  \\nFemale Professor  Exactly. Having an efficient means of transportation, well that helped the \\nIroquois to form a federation, linked by natural waterways, and this federation \\nexpanded from uh what is now southern Canada all the way south to the \\nDelaware River. And eh this efficiency of the birch bark canoes also made an \\nimpression on newcomers to the area. French traders in the seventeenth \\ncentury modeled their … eh well they adopted the design of the Iroquois \\nbirch bark canoes and they found that they could travel great distances—more \\nthan 1500 kilometers a month. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

Begin reading now. \\nReading Time: 45 seconds \\nBehavior Modification \\nIndividuals often modify their behavior based on what they have learned about the possible \\nconsequences of their actions. When an individual learns through experience that a certain behavior \\nresults in pleasant consequences, that behavior is likely to be repeated. An unpleasant consequence, \\non the other hand, discourages further repetition of the behavior. While behavior modification can \\nbe observed in experiments, it also occurs frequently in everyday settings, when individuals change \\ntheir behavior based on what they have learned about the consequences of that behavior. \\nNarrator  Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic in a psychology class. \\nMale Professor  This happens all the time with kids, in schools. Say there’s a little boy or girl \\nwho’s just starting school. Well, they’re not really used to the rules about \\nproper behavior for a classroom, so at the beginning, they might, I don’t \\nknow, interrupt the teacher, walk around the classroom when they’re \\nsupposed to be sitting down. You know, just misbehaving in general. OK, but \\nwhat happens? Well, the teacher gets angry with them when they act this way. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

And according to \\nreading too, the patt-um,  behavior  modification  can  be  observed  both  in  experiments  and  in  \\nreal  life.  The  professor  gives a example of-of observation of the modification in real life  \\nabout kids. First when kids first moved in school,  they  do  not  know the  rules,  so  they  do  \\nthings  like,  uh,  walking  around  when  they’re  not  supposed to or talking, uh, when teacher’s \\nspeaking. This behaviors will result in punishments like um, the teacher’s, uh, reproaching \\nthem about how inappropriate that is. And soon-soon--soon they learn to behave better, um, \\nbecause uh if they learn to raise hands, um, and or keeps out in the class is more pleasant, \\nteachers praise them, through this they learned, um, this behavior is better for them.  \\nRationale: \\nOverall, the speaker is clear and easy to understand. His pronunciation is generally good and \\nhe uses intonation effectively to express meaning. He is able to use a range of simple and \\ncomplex grammatical structures and vocabulary to express his ideas, although he makes \\nseveral minor errors such as errors in agreement (“this behaviors”) and dropping pronouns \\nand articles (“learn to raise [their] hands”). These errors don’t obscure meaning for the \\nlistener. His vocabulary use is often very precise and effective (“…reproaching them about \\nhow inappropriate that is…”). His definition of behavior modification is clear and accurate. \\nHe is able to summarize key points from the lecture to support the definitions. \\nOverall, this is a mostly coherent and accurate synthesis of the reading and listening material. \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

OK?  If  people  have  a  choice  between  two  identically  \\npriced  products,  which one will they choose? They choose the one they \\nthink is of higher quality, of course. But what does it mean for a product \\nto be a high-quality product? Well, business analysts usually speak of \\ntwo major factors of quality—one factor is reliability, and the other is \\nwhat we call features.  \\nSo,  reliability.  What’s  reliability?  Well,  a  product  is  reliable  if  it  works  \\nthe  way  we  expect  it  to  work,  if  it  can  go  a  reasonable  amount of  time  \\nwithout  needing  repairs. If a product, a car for example, doesn’t work \\nthe way it should and needs repairs too soon, we say it’s [stress on the  \\nfirst syllable] unreliable. So, product reliability means, basically, the \\nabsence  of defects or problems that you weren’t expecting. [pause] It \\nused to be that when people thought about product quality, they thought \\nmainly about reliability. Today it’s different. People do still care about \\nreliability, don’t get me  wrong. It’s just that manufacturing standards are  \\nso now  so high that, take cars for example, today, today’s cars all very \\nreliable. So reliability is important, but it’s not gonna be the deciding \\nfactor.  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

The Chevalier was a somewhat controversial figure, but since he met \\nmany famous people, including kings and writers, his memoir has become a valuable historical \\nsource about European society in the eighteenth century.

They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many \\nevents in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. \\nFor example, in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very \\nwealthy, and it is known that he spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. \\nHowever, evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money \\nfrom a Swiss merchant.

However,  critics  complain  that  the  memoir  cannot  possibly  capture  \\nthese conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the  conversations \\noccurred. Critics point out that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended \\nconversations held many years earlier.  \\nCritics have also questioned the memoir’s account of the Chevalier’s escape from a notorious \\nprison in Venice, Italy. He claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to \\nmake a hole  in  the  ceiling  and  climbing  through  the  roof.  Critics  claim  that  while  such  a  daring \\nescape  makes for  enjoyable  reading,  it  is  more  likely  that  the  Chevalier’s  jailers  were  bribed  to  free  \\nhim.  They  point out that the Chevalier had a number of politically well-connected friends in \\nVenice who could have offered a bribe.  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

Let’s look at the accuracy of the three episodes mentioned in the \\nreading. \\nFirst, the loan from the merchant: Well, that doesn’t mean that the Chevalier \\nwas poor. Let me  explain. We know that in Switzerland, the Chevalier  spent  \\nhuge  amounts  of  money  on  parties  and  on  gambling.  And he had wealth, but it \\nwas the kind of property you have to sell first to get money. So, it usually \\ntook a few days to convert his assets into actual money.  So,  when  he  ran out  \\nof  cash,  he  had  to  borrow  some  while  he  was waiting for his money to \\narrive—but that’s not being poor!  \\nSecond, the conversations with Voltaire: The Chevalier states in his memoir \\nthat each night, immediately after conversing with Voltaire, he wrote down \\neverything he could remember about that particular night’s conversation. \\nEvidently, the Chevalier kept his notes of these conversations for many years \\nand referred to them when writing the memoir.  Witnesses  who  lived  with  the  \\nChevalier  in  his  later  life  confirm that he regularly consulted notes and \\njournals when composing the memoir.  \\nThird, the Chevalier’s escape from the prison in Venice: Other prisoners in \\nthat prison had even more powerful friends than he did, and none of them \\nwere  ever able to bribe their way to freedom, so bribery hardly seems  likely  in  \\nhis  case.  The  best  evidence,  though,  comes  from  some  old Venetian \\ngovernment documents. They indicate that soon after the Chevalier escaped \\nfrom the prison, the ceiling of his old prison room had to be repaired. Why \\nwould they need to repair a ceiling unless he had escaped exactly as he said  \\nhe did?  \\nToward the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725−1798) wrote a \\nlong memoir recounting his life and adventures.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'src/TOEFL iBT Free Practice Test (ETS).pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content=\"  \\n    \\n \\nSample Responses \\nTask 1 – This is a mid-level response. \\nGiving some logical reasons,the professor is defending the Chevalier;s memoir and making it  \\nreliable.She uses sophistications to make the critics convince that their  claim on memoir is not \\ntrue.  First of all,she  mentions the issue about borrowing some money from a merchant by \\nChevalier.She thinks the Chevalier was in trouble  with cash and he hadnt enough time to \\nprepare it .He hadn't time to sell his own properties and estates to provide the money.so the \\nloan is reasonable and it doesnt show his poverty.Secondly,the critics say that he escaped out \\nthe jail by bribing the watchman.But we know that there  were  more  powerful  men  there  in  the  \\njail  with  much  more  powerful  friends  and  relations  that  made the escape so easir  for them but  \\nthey weren't able to escape.Therefor,we can accept what the Chevalier have said about the \\nway he could manage to escape  from the prison using a piece of metal and digging the \\nceiling.And the last reason the critics gives on unreliability of the Chevalier's memoir is that \\nthe details of the conversation between Chelavier and Voltaire is not truely  mentioned in \\ndetails in the Chelavier's memoir. They believe that there's a long period of time between the \\ntime they were  conversing and the time  Chelavier wrote that on paper.And it is impossible to \\nwrite the exact talk that was occured at that time.However ,the professor solves the dillema  \\neasily.In his point of view,the Chevalier had a chance to get the tool due to the watchmen's \\ncome and go to repair the ceiling.  \\nOverall  the  professor  is trying  to make  his opinion  seem to  be  true.  \\nRationale: \\nThis  response  is  in  the  medium  writing  proficiency  range. It  would  probably  earn  the  score  of  \\n3  based  on the Integrated Writing Scoring Rubric. The  writer manages to convey some lecture  \\ninformation in response to the points made in the reading passage, but some ideas are omitted, \\nunclear, or poorly connected. In response to the argument that the Chevalier was poor because  \\nwe know he had to borrow money, the writer explains that the Chevalier was short on cash \\nbut not necessarily poor  because he had other assets, which took some time to sell. Second, in \\nresponse to the reading argument that the Chevalier probably bribed his way out of prison \\nrather than  escaping, the  writer conveys the argument that other, more powerful men were not \\nable to escape from the same prison. However, the writer does not clearly explain that they \\nwere unable to escape through bribery. Finally, the writer summarizes the reading argument \\nthat the Chevalier would have been unlikely to remember his conversations with Voltaire so \\nmany years later, but then, confusingly, returns to the Chevalier’s escape from the prison.  \\nThe writer tries to indicate (but not very clearly) that the Chevalier was able to get out of the \\nprison by using the tools  of a person who came to repair the  ceiling. Apart from not \\nconnecting ideas well in this part  of  the  response  and  not  responding  to  the  reading  argument  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

The errors in the use of language are  fairly frequent in this response  and \\nobscure  the meaning of  several ideas. A  few  \\nexamples: “She  uses sophistications to make the critics convince”; “powerful friends and \\nrelations that made the escape so easier  for them but they weren't able to escape”; “he  could \\nmanage to escape  from the prison using a piece of metal and digging the ceiling”; “the last \\nreason the  critics gives on unreliability of the Chevalier's  memoir  is  that  the  details  of  the  \\nconversation  between  Chelavier  and  Voltaire  is  not  truely mentioned in details in the  \\nChelavier's memoir.”  \\nTask 1 – This is a high-level response. \\nThe professor starts by saying that no memoir is completely accurate but she believes that the \\nmemoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt was fairly accurate and can be used as a valuable \\nhostorical source. Though some critics disagree she is convinced that the memoir is accurate \\nabout it's details and has given considerable proof in her lecture. \\nWhile living in Switzerland the Chevalier mentions that he was wealthy and that he would \\nindulge in extravaganzas like parties and gambling. The new evidence that the Chevalier did, \\ninfact, borrow money from Swiss merchants does not necessarily mean that he was poor. On \\nthe contrary the Professor theorizes that the Chevalier had a lot of assets as wealth and it \\nwould require time for him to convert the assets into readily useable currency. In such \\nunfortunate circumstances where his vices would  require  immediate  money  he  would  borrow  \\nsome,  for  the  time  being,  only  to  pay  them  back  later. Her theory is logical and sound.  \\nThe second piece  critics would like to disclaim as true is the count of all conversations with \\nVoltaire which he  recorded with accuracy in his memoir which was penned down years later. \\nThe professor puts forward the fact that the Chevalier would dutifuly make  a note of the entire  \\nlength of the conversation  every  night  after  meeting  with  Voltaire.  Such  an  act  is  confirmed  by  \\nwitnesses  who  saw  the Chevalier refer to journals and notes while writing his memoir.  \\nThe final piece is the account of the dramatic jail break from Venice where he used a piece of \\nmetal to crerate a hole in the roof and then escaped. Such an account, though hard to believe, \\nmight actually be true as the Professor points out to some Italian government records dating \\nback to that time which shows repairs being carried out to the cieling of the very same cell in \\nwhich the Chevalier was imprisoned. \\nThough  it  may  seem  a  bit  dramatic  and  over  the  top,  on  the  outset,  the  Professor  is  convinced \\nthat the memoirs of the Chevalier were true and accurate and could be used as a historical \\nreference towards eighteenth century Europe.  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

It  would  probably  earn  the  score  of  5  \\nbased  on  the Integrated Writing Scoring Rubric. The response is well organized, conveys the  \\nimportant information from all three lecture points, and connects it well with information that \\nwas presented in the reading passage. In response to the reading argument that the Chevalier \\nde Seingalt exaggerated his wealth because we know he was forced to borrow money; the  \\nwriter correctly conveys the lecturer’s argument that the Chevalier needed the loans only \\nbecause his considerable  assets could not always be quickly converted into cash. In response \\nto the argument that the  Chevalier could not possibly remember his  conversations  with  \\nVoltaire  so  many  years  later,  the  writer  conveys  that  the  Chevalier  based  his  memoirs on \\nextensive notes he took at the time of his conversations with the famous author. Finally, in \\nresponse to the argument that the Chevalier’s description of his escape from prison through a  \\nhole in a ceiling is hard to believe, the writer conveys the argument that the  Chevalier’s \\naccount is supported by the historical records describing ceiling repairs in the prison where he  \\nwas held. There are a  few minor language  errors (“it's details”, “count of all conversations”, \\n“records… which shows repairs being carried out”, “on the outset”) but they do not interfere  \\nwith meaning in any way. In fact, the  writer is very skilled in using sophisticated and accurate \\nparaphrasing to convey the content from the lecture and the passage. A few examples:  “he  \\nwould indulge in extravaganzas like parties and gambling”; “conversations with Voltaire  \\nwhich he recorded with accuracy in his memoir which was penned down years later”; “repairs \\nbeing carried out to the cieling [ceiling] of the very same cell in which the  Chevalier was \\nimprisoned.”  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.

But first, I want to know what you \\nthink about this topic. So here’s a question for the  class discussion board:  \\nWhat do you think is the most significant effect that watching television has on people? Why do \\nyou think television has this effect?  \\nKelly  \\nI know that one way that television influences people’s behavior is that when you are  watching \\ntelevision, you are not moving around or exercising. This is especially true for children. The  \\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics says that when children spend a lot of time watching \\ntelevision, they have a greater tendency to be overweight.  \\nPaul  \\nI think the main effect that television has on people is to broaden their  experience. There  are so \\nmany programs devoted to nature and travel. Think of all the different places in the world you \\ncan experience through television! Last night I  watched a program about life in Antarctica, and \\nit was fascinating!  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

There are so many \\ninteresting channels and programs, and they make people laugh during watching TV. I think \\nthis is a big effect that television on people, as time is passing by. Especially these days, \\npeople lives with the serious problems and accidents. People need something fresh and can \\nentertain. Televisions do these kind of works very well. Through Music program, people can \\nhave relaxing time, through comedy program, people can laugh... and so on. Therefore, the \\ntelevision influences people's feeling much better, and I think this is very important effect!! \\nRationale: \\nThis essay is in the medium writing proficiency range. It would probably earn the score of 3 \\nbased on the Academic  Discussion Scoring Rubric. It is a mostly understandable contribution \\nto the discussion. The writer provides a different point of view than either Kelly or Paul, \\narguing that TV “makes the life more interesting.” (But including the article “the” in “the life”  \\nis a mistake. The correct phrase is “makes life more interesting.”) The writer then explains \\nwhy people welcome a bit of TV fun: they “lives with the serious problems and accidents” \\n(the correct phrasing would be “they live with serious problems or experience accidents”), \\nand “through Music program” (should be  “when watching music programs”) they can relax, \\n“through comedy program” (should be “when watching comedy programs”) they can laugh, \\nand so on. But there is quite of bit of repetition of the same idea: TV is fun and makes people \\nlaugh. Also, some ideas are unclear: what does the writer mean by “as time is passing by” in \\nthe third sentence? The  writer seems unable to provide many clearly expressed details or  to \\nelaborate on the basic ideas, and so the contribution to the discussion feels only partly \\nsuccessful. There  are noticeable errors in almost every sentence. In addition to the ones  \\nindicated above, there is “a big effect that television on people” (which should read “a big \\neffect that television has on people”), “People need something fresh and can entertain”  (which \\nshould read “People need something fresh and entertaining”), and others. However, most of \\nthe meaning is still understandable despite the errors.  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS. All rights reserved.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'src/TOEFL iBT Free Practice Test (ETS).pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content=\" \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\nTask 2 –  This is a high-level response.  \\nIn my opinion, Paul is right when he says that watching television might broaden your \\nexperience. By watching for example science programs, you can gain valueable insights into \\nnew topics. On the other hand, I think that a high percentage of people don't watch TV to \\nincrease their knowledge. I am of the opinion that many people watch TV in order to get \\ndistracted from their real lives. They watch films or series to be entertained and to forget \\nproblems they have at work or in their private lives. At least for me this works well - for \\ninstance if I am sad, I watch a comedy or a funny soap opera and afterwards, I am in a better \\nmood. Therefore, I think that being entertained and distracted is the most significant effect of \\nTV. \\nRationale:  \\nThis response is in the high writing proficiency range. It would probably earn the score of 5 \\nbased on the Academic  Discussion Scoring Rubric. The writer conveys complex and well-\\nargued ideas that contribute nicely to the discussion. While the writer mentions Paul’s point  \\nof view, the writer does not just repeat it. Instead, the writer takes Paul’s ideas as the starting \\npoint, and goes on to present a different point of view, arguing that watching TV is not mainly \\neducational but rather a  relaxing experience. The  writer then goes on to develop this point of \\nview, explaining why people need to relax, and providing the writer’s own personal \\nexperiences: why the writer usually watches TV, which programs, and so on.  \\nThe language the writer uses has a nice variety, both in how the sentences are formed and in \\nthe range of the vocabulary used. There are almost no errors; the word “valuable” in the  \\nsecond sentence is misspelled, but that may be expected from even competent writers writing  \\nunder timed  conditions, as the Scoring Rubric explains.  \\nCopyright © 2023 by ETS.
